      My career in technology has always been about passion. When I started it
      was a passion for the art of coding. I constantly strived to learn new
      languages and build my skill set. As my skill set grew it became a passion
      for building great experiences for my customers. And finally it became a
      passion for building great teams, that were fun and innovative.

      Every day I like to code, teach, mentor and build. It's not easy to do,
      but nothing worth doing ever is. I strive to be the kind of person you
      wake up wanting to go work with, because that's the kind of person I want
      to work with.
