    <p>My career in technology has always been about passion. When I started it was a passion for the art of coding. I constantly strived to learn new languages and build my skill set. As my skill set grew it became a passion for building great experiences for my customers. And finally it became a passion for building great teams, that were fun an innovative.</p>
    <p>Every day I like to code, teach, mentor and build. It's not easy to do, but nothing worth doing ever is. I strive to be the kind of person you wake up wanting to go work with, because that's the kid of person I want to work with.</p>
